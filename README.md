# KANalya: experiments with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, in d'Artagnan style

Currently this repo is planned to be a sandbox for my experiments with KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks) and SSM (state space models), but it might change and cover broader range of KAN-involved network architectures.

The naming of the project is arbitrary, this is how the word `scoundrel` sounds in Russian, also, it's a word yelled by d'Artagnan in The Three Musketeers movie.

I plan to yell, run in circles, repeat again, and use this pet project to save a damsel in distress - me in my last year of PhD.

## Installation
```{bash}
git clone https://github.com/latticetower/kanalya.git
cd kanalya
pip install -e .
```

The scripts, if present, should be run from the project root directory.

## Ideas & TODO
